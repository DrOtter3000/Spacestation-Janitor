# Spacestation-Janitor

This game was written for the Godot Wild Jam #59. Topic is malfunction.
It is a 3D action game. You are the janitor of a spacestation where all the service-robots became crazy by a malefunction in the lower decks. So you have to repair the control unit. Feel free to fork the game or just play it.
